The implementation is done using C language


- Data structure: the tree is of type binary tree with left and right child and a data holder. 
- A pretty print was added in order to give a big picture of the data contained in the tree.
- The algorithm does not use any additional space.
- The algorithm runs at a time complexity of almost O(N).
